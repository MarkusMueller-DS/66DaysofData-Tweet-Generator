@KenJee_DS It makes you held accountable to public when u accept such commitment. Although the path which I'll be following is different but that's not what #66daysofdata is all about. It's goal is to make a new habit.😁 joined twitter solely for participating in #66daysofdata
#66daysofdata I'm on board @KenJee_DS. Today kaggle micro-course on pandas.
Just watched @KenJee_DS announced his #66daysofdata challenge. Thinking of doing the same. This will be good practice for putting yourself out there and feeling comfortable with your work.
#66daysofdata @KenJee_DS just started my journey in this new field. Learned basic python and created github and kaggle accounts so far. Going to start an online data science course and try to complete small projects as well. Wish you all happy learning.
So excited to start this journey  #66daysofdata. I have just start learning Data Science. Thank you.
"Day 1 of #66daysofdata Today I have learned about 1)""Handling Imbalanced Dataset"" using SMOTE(Oversampling technique) and its hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.2) Classification metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score, ROC AUC Curve etc.@KenJee_DS"

"Day 7, 8 of #66daysofdata So far, I've been studying the theoretical basis of ML.- Maths for ML: Linear Algebra (Week 5)- Hands-On Machine Learning (Ch 2)- The Art of Statistics (Ch 1)"
#QuestionOfTheDay How important is regularisation in preventing overfitting of a model? Are there any easy sources to understand this (without going into too much of mathematics)? #66daysofdata #100DaysOfCode #100DaysOfMLCode #MachineLearning #DataScience
"Titanic: Model tuning. Haven't made new submission yet, but I think I can hope for slightly better results this time ! (Better data wrangling could further boost my score)#66daysofdata"
"#66daysofdata Day 5:I will continue reading and hopefully finish Chapter 2 of "" Intro to ML with #Python "". I need to review the code better before proceeding to new concepts."
"Day 12 of #66DaysOfData! ""Machine Learning"" by AndrewYNg on @coursera.Part of the course:- Week4/Neural Networks: Representation(1/2)"
restarting #66daysofdata 😔will stick to it this time. Day 1. Read chapter 2 of An Introduction to Statistical Learning
Day 5 of #66daysofdata Not that productive this time. I reviewed my notes so far and looked for a #MachineLearning book to buy
Day 9 and 10 of #66daysofdata are spent with statistics and ML courses. I started a scikit tutorial by DataSchool on YouTube today. And it's been great so far.
"Day10 #66DaysOfData with @KenJee_DS After 9 days of hard work I decided to take a break, So I've done a very small learning seance https://t.co/N1g105nQtu"

"Day 12 of #66DaysOfData @KenJee_DS More work on ODIR5K dataset. Tomorrow I'll test a more complex, convolution-based classifier, do some last improvements and move over this dataset to something more related to NLP.https://t.co/PFoOlliUvF"
"Day 9 of #66daysofdata:Today, I am reading about out-of-vocabulary words in n-gram language models, and it made me want to find a way to incorporate part of speech in an n-gram model."
"#66daysofdata day 12 @KenJee_DS True to my word, I decided to try putting some of the data viz learnings into practice - it is quite hilarious because I spent an hour refreshing my knowledge and creating meaningless charts Practice is useful I guess..."
"Day 11: - Studied about DB API what is it ,why it is use and about there methods.- And also studied about data wrangling, how to handle the missing value and data formatting.#66daysofdata"
"#66daysofdata Hey @KenJee_DS  today I have a question for you? I went through a ton of resources but couldn't find some funny but at the same time educational resource to learn data science ! What do you think , shouldn't there be a funnier way ?"

"Day 12 of #66daysofdata: For imbalanced data, classification accuracy is not always a good evaluation metric, since even a dummy 'most frequent' classifier will give us great accuracy. We can use recall if we want to minimize false negatives, or precision if we want to 1/2"
"For Day 12 of #66DaysOfData I read about transformation pipelines in Hands on Machine Learning. I am trying to get into the habit of looking up the documentation when I want to find out more about a topic, but so far I am finding the scikit learn docs a little overwhelming."
"Day 14 of #66daysofdataI learned about training Neural N/W with backpropogation, and also about training multi-layered NN. Also I learned about gradient descent, learning rate and how we update weights using GD.I also took UFC data from kaggle and did 2 out of 3 tasks."
"@TelSurferBelle Yeah.. The first week served as  getting to see the reflection of our real selves, and how we procrastinate, at least for me. Heres to starting a new week stronger, and smarter. There's so much potential in #66daysofdata and us."

"Pretty fascinating to see how these algorithms find non-convex clusters. One takeaway is that representative-based clustering uses only distance between points to determine clusters, where Density-based clustering uses the local density of points.#datascience #66daysofdata"
