<|startoftext|>Day 12 of #66daysofdata: For imbalanced data, classification accuracy is not always a good evaluation metric, since even a dummy 'most frequent' classifier will give us great accuracy. We can use recall if we want to minimize false negatives, or precision if we want to 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For Day 12 of #66DaysOfData I read about transformation pipelines in Hands on Machine Learning. I am trying to get into the habit of looking up the documentation when I want to find out more about a topic, but so far I am finding the scikit learn docs a little overwhelming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 14 of #66daysofdataI learned about training Neural N/W with backpropogation, and also about training multi-layered NN. Also I learned about gradient descent, learning rate and how we update weights using GD.I also took UFC data from kaggle and did 2 out of 3 tasks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TelSurferBelle Yeah.. The first week served as  getting to see the reflection of our real selves, and how we procrastinate, at least for me. Heres to starting a new week stronger, and smarter. There's so much potential in #66daysofdata and us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hi guys please suggest me from where should I learn python for data science.I am new to DS.Need some catching to do.#66daysofdata<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started with the #66daysofdata, will try to document my daily data science work. Worked on a #LinearRegression model - an Ecommerce  clothing company  trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.https://t.co/YBT9dQ4eUd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 2 | #66daysofdata -started a #Coursera project on predictive analysis using Microsoft Azure ML Studio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#66daysofdata  - Week 1: Gradient Descent ML ; also will start learning Naive Bayesian concept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#QuestionOfTheDay Which algorithms require scaling ? When should scaling be done? Is scaling performed on categorical variables? #66daysofdata #MachineLearning #Data #DataScience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 8 of #66daysofdata I have decided to have a 'lazy' today and I just watched a couple of Ken's videos. Will start chapter 3 of "Intro to ML" tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 7 and 8 #66daysofdata I started reading the 'Hands-on #MachineLearning' book. Almost finished chapter 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vision and Learning Lab has advised our Research Assistants to participate in global challenges. To improve programming and learn new technologies we recommend #100DaysOfCode .To introduce our lab's research assistants to Data Science Field , we are recommending #66DaysOfData .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are happy to announce that 3 of our Research Assistants have voluntarily participated in #100DaysOfCode and #66DaysOfData challenges. We wish them best of luck.Follow them at :Ahsan Goheer - @codebear101Haadia Amjad - @HaadiaAmjadAbdullah Aslam - @Shaykhiyan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I applied convolution and pooling layers to my neural network for the first time.#deepneuralnetwork #Kaggle #beginner #66daysofdata https://t.co/ZkIheuqFVO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those CNN are showing that not only quality of data matters, but the quantity as well. Compared to others kagglers, I used a much smaller sample of pictures and it shows in my model being fitted right now. Oops!#66daysofdata<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 15 of #66DaysOfData:Learned some data transformation tricks to make certain data easier to model. Here's why you might want to transform your data:- To see the data structure differently- To reduce skew- To straighten a nonlinear relationship#DataScience #Statistics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) Use sigmoid and a single neuron for classification at the end. 2) making the dense layer just before bigger helps 3) turning on the GPU on Kaggle makes everything faster for CNN ... you have been warned girls and boys ;)#66daysofdata<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#66daysofdata Day 11: Yesterday was a busy day, I didn't have a lot of time. But I was able to finish unit 3 from the Probability course, I studied independence, pairwise independence and reliability :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 14:Moving ahead in exploratory data analysis. Learn linear regression and multiple regression.#66daysofDatahttps://t.co/i1Rut8q9iO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moar fun with CNN, using data augmentation, Did some tests to try and mess up the generator ... remember the 'demon kitty' from before? bastard's trying to hide in the corner to get the jump on us! Careful! :P#66daysofdata https://t.co/t1ruCk6AIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>day-15 of #66daysofdata finally done with Advanced SQL on #kaggle. Now the next target will be another course #DataCleaning. Here are two very useful functions to compare the efficiency of d/f queries---&gt;&gt;<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#66DaysOfData Day 9. Missed posting yesterday, still working on preprocessing data for a project. Today learned to find and deal with outliers through Tukey's and winsorize methods<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 18 of #66daysofdata: K-Fold cross-validation randomly splits our data into k folds, takes in turn each fold as test set, and trains the model on the rest. If our data has a high class imbalance, some folds may not have a good representation from the minority class(es), 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hoping this will assuage some of my confusion. So far I find the book very approachable, and it is helping me understand how linear regression works mathematically. Day 18 of #66DaysOfData Day of 30  #100DaysOfCode<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Day 25 of #66DaysOfDataselect `from` from `where`Confusing, right? This is where capitalization become useful. #SQL is not case sensitive but capitalization increases readability:SELECT `from` FROM `where`It is selecting a column named 'from' in a table named 'where'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 26 of #66DaysOfDataSQL has a different way of looking at NULL values. In C language we have NULL as null pointer (char *p == 0) and null terminated strings ('\0'). In Python, Null or null object simply means a value of NoneType.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 26 of #66daysofdata: Feature selection is an important part of model building, which reduces no. of input features to a select few. It makes training faster and our models simpler (fewer parameters), and may even improve performance by removing non-informative features. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Day 39 of the #66DaysOfData;I got the data of my first project by using beautifulsoup and turned it into a csv file.That's one small step for mankind, one giant leap for me. üòÜNow it's time to do analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 37 of #66daysofdata Today I introduced myself to Principle Component Analysis, it seems similar to non dimensional analysis from engineering but obviously different that said I will probably need to revisit this when I'm more knowledgeable üòÖ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsCSAmador I'd say yes as long as they're in the sense of being eager for more, and not stressed.  I'm excited to learn more DS and it takes a lot less energy to get me started on the days' work than at the start of the #66daysofdata.So I'd say that's a good thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4/66: correction from earlier.. it is micro course not macro.. confused my macro counting to macro course üòú Anyways got halfway done so far. Let me see if I can finish 5th chapter before going to bed. Now it‚Äôs time for üö¥ #66daysofdata<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>... and then try imputation for missing values. Wow! That was a long post (hence why I had to split it up many times :P ).Also, a lesson learned from this: Implement good practices for versioning your code ... but more importantly ... DO THE SAME FOR YOUR DATA!! #66daysofdata<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#66DaysOfData question: Is there a guideline for how many values should be missing in a column before you just drop that feature from the dataset entirely? People will say "it depends," so what does it depend on? I invite you to discuss. üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 7 of #66DaysOfDataStarted the morning with a lovely coffee morning with @WWCodeBlock. Then on Udemy I finished the probabilities section and started on statistics.

<|startoftext|>Day 2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ of #66daysofdata #100DaysOfCode Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function.The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient of the function at the current point https://t.co/BdBSi9kSAM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ of #66daysofdata #100DaysOfCode ...Gradient Descent is attributed to Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847.Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907.Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by HaskelCurry in 1944 https://t.co/BbOaDwSR4o<|endoftext|>
